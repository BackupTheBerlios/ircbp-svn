What We Need To Do
++++++++++++++++++


AIM:

Create a portable C++ Library that can be used for IRC Bots, while also for general while also been able to provide a Library to IRC Clients!



Library Type:

We can either use a .lib, or a .dll (or provide both) I'm gonna start with the latter, but we can always swap back at some other point.
